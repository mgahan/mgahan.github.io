      <description>If you would like to follow along: This tutorial assumes the user has already downloaded and installed the following:
 Docker  Mac OSX: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/ Windows: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/  AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)  https://aws.amazon.com/cli/    Why docker is useful?  No worries about missing dependencies, packages, and other pain points during subsequent deployments
 Reduce/eliminate concerns about compatibility on different platforms. This has the potential to eliminate much of our Windows/Mac issues.</description>
